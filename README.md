# Neural networks from scratch
This project is a comprehensive exploration of neural networks and backpropagation implemented from scratch. The goal is to understand the inner workings of how a neural network fundamentally works by providing clear, step-by-step mathematical implementations and some visualizations.

This project is inspired on Andrej Karpathy's backpropagation youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) 

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts:

  - **Backpropagation Notebook**:
    - [`Backpropagation Notebook.py`](https://github.com/antoniocreal/Basic-neural-network-from-scratch/blob/main/Backpropagation%20from%20scratch.ipynb): An in-depth implementation of the backpropagation algorithm from the ground up.
      
  - **Neural Networks Notebook**:
      - [`Neural Networks Notebook.py`](https://github.com/antoniocreal/Basic-neural-network-from-scratch/blob/main/Neural%20networks%20from%20scratch.ipynb): A basic neural network built from scratch, demonstrating how weights, operations, and data flow through the network.
